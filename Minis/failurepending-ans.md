Case: You have a disk dying in 24 hours.
2 steps to fix the issue:

1) Immediately do a system or hard disk backup
  - back up all data from the failing disk
  - follow company policies and backup practices:
  where I used to work backups would be done on the user's machine. 
  User profiles would be created on Drives and their data wuill be saved. 

2) In this case, getting a new system for the boss will be the best option
but another option will be replacing the hard drive
  - make sure the new system is all sedt up for the user
  - for my old job, a system admin would log on the machine and find the user's
  data backed up on the drives and just copy the user's profile/data on the new
  machine.
  
3) Have user log on the new machine and verify that his pofile/data is there
and that everything is working properly.

**
Data can also be backed up on external hard drives. Windows 10 has an easy 
way of backing up data. The external hard drive will need to be set up. 
Formatting hard disk partitions will be required, once finished just back up files 
to the disk.
